# Building CGF Projector (Windows)

Verified 2026-07-26 on Windows 11, starting from a machine with **no Qt installed**.
Total time from nothing to a running exe: about five minutes on a fast connection.

## Toolchain (one-time, ~4 GB, no admin rights needed)

Requires Python 3 with pip.

```
pip install aqtinstall
aqt install-qt   windows desktop 6.8.3 win64_mingw --modules qtmultimedia --outputdir C:\Users\<you>\Qt
aqt install-tool windows desktop tools_mingw1310 qt.tools.win64_mingw1310 --outputdir C:\Users\<you>\Qt
```

## Build

From Git Bash (adjust `<you>`):

```
export PATH="/c/Users/<you>/Qt/Tools/mingw1310_64/bin:/c/Users/<you>/Qt/6.8.3/mingw_64/bin:$PATH"
cd src
qmake softProjector.pro -spec win32-g++
mingw32-make -j8
```

Output: `src/win32_build/bin/SoftProjector.exe`

## Deploy (self-contained portable folder)

```
windeployqt --qmldir qml win32_build/bin/SoftProjector.exe
```

The resulting `bin/` folder (~106 MB) is portable. The app reads
`spData.sqlite` from the folder the exe lives in.

## Fixes needed vs upstream master (97a88e7, 2025-09-16)

- `3rdparty/headers/qmediaplaylist.h` — removed `#include <qmediaenumdebug.h>`
  and the two `Q_MEDIA_ENUM_DEBUG(...)` lines. That header was removed in newer
  Qt 6 releases; it only provided debug pretty-printing for enums. No
  functional impact.

## Build-gate log (2026-07-26)

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Toolchain install (aqt, Qt 6.8.3 + MinGW 13.1) | 83 s |
| Compile (41 sources, one error → 3-line fix → rebuild) | ~90 s total |
| Executable | 2.2 MB (deployed folder 106 MB) |
| Launch against copy of production DB (8,386 songs, 124,425 verses, 4 Bibles) | Main window up, no crash (15 s smoke) |
| Compiler warnings | 91, non-fatal — to be triaged during transformation |

**Verdict: Qt 6 master is viable as the CGF Projector base.**

Remaining gate items before heavy investment:
1. 60-minute dual-display soak on booth-class hardware with the real workload.
2. A second person reproduces this build from this file alone.
